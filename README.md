# Pi-Projects
This directory contains a variety of projects for the Raspberry Pi B+. The main project is a web page to display information obtained from a DHT11 temperature/humidity module. The other two files utilize Computer Vision for motion detection with a camera attached to the Pi (not complete) and a test of a sound sensor module to detect noise.

## Takeaways
* Flask is used to create a web interface. Understanding is required of how flask interacts with templates and HTTP Methods.
* Understanding of Rasberry Pi Pin-outs and connections are required to handle the DHT11 sample. Example code is shown under the temperatureHumidity directory.

**Note:** This is a personal application not designed for commercial or widespread use. The code is undergoing improvement (and perhaps drastic changes) since this is an initial draft of the application.
